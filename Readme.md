# OBSOLETE - How to suppress the save confirmation when closing a new unmodified object DetailView

With XAF v19.2, we no longer show the save confirmation dialog when a user closes DetailView for a new unmodified object in a WinForms application. You can also test the new behavior in v19.1.5 with one option (ConfirmCloseUnchangedNewObject). For more information, see the following breaking change: [WinForms - The save confirmation dialog is not shown when closing DetailView for a new unmodified object](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/bc5122/winforms-the-save-confirmation-dialog-is-not-shown-when-closing-detailview-for-a-new).
