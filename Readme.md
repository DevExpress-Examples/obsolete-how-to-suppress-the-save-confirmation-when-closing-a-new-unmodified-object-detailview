# OBSOLETE - How to suppress the save confirmation when closing a new unmodified object DetailView

## Scenario  
This example demonstrates how to implement the following behavior (which is default in Microsoft Outlook) in XAF Windows Forms applications:

- A user can create a new record, and when its detail form is opened he or she may close the form without entering any data (e.g., a new record was created by accident). In this case, the form can be closed without any save confirmation, because no user data needs to be saved.

- If a user enters some data into the form and then closes it, the save confirmation appears as expected not to lose entered data.  
To test it, run [<u>functional tests</u>](http://documentation.devexpress.com/#Xaf/CustomDocument3206) from the _E2114.EasyTests\E2114.ets_ folder.

## Implementation Steps
### v19.2+
With XAF v19.2, we no longer show the save confirmation dialog when a user closes DetailView for a new unmodified object in a WinForms application. You can also test the new behavior in v19.1.5 with one option (ConfirmCloseUnchangedNewObject). For more information, see the following breaking change: [WinForms - The save confirmation dialog is not shown when closing DetailView for a new unmodified object](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/bc5122/winforms-the-save-confirmation-dialog-is-not-shown-when-closing-detailview-for-a-new).


### Older Versions
To enable this feature for versions prior to v19.2, copy the _WinSolution.Module.Win\SuppressConfirmationForNewObjectsDetailViewController.xx_ file into _YourSolutionName.Module.Win_ project.
